# PersonalWebsite

My personal website at: www.filipslatinac.com. This was made in summer 2016, when i first started learning web technologies. It has no responsive support, nor is it well written code-wise. The css is everywhere and the javascript manipulates the DOM a bit too much considering the simplicity of the website.
